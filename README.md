# Parallel Programming - AGH University  

## About the Course  
This repository contains projects developed as part of the **Parallel and Distributed Computing** course at **AGH University of Science and Technology**. The course focuses on fundamental techniques for parallel programming, performance optimization, and the practical implementation of parallel algorithms.  

Students learn how to write, analyze, and optimize parallel programs using **Pthreads, OpenMP, MPI**, and other concurrency mechanisms.  

## Projects Overview  

Each folder contains a specific project related to parallel computing, with a **detailed task description** inside. The implementations use **C, C++, and Java** in Linux-based environments.  

### ðŸ”¹ Topics Covered
- **Parallel and Concurrent Processing**  
  Introduction to process and thread management in parallel systems.  
- **Pthreads (POSIX Threads)**  
  Implementation of multithreading using the Pthreads library in C.  
- **Java Concurrency**  
  Using Java's concurrency utilities to create parallel applications.  
- **Shared Memory Parallelism (OpenMP)**  
  Developing parallel applications for multi-core processors with OpenMP.  
- **Distributed Memory Parallelism (MPI)**  
  Implementing parallel algorithms for distributed systems using MPI.  
- **Performance Analysis and Optimization**  
  Measuring and improving the efficiency of parallel programs.  

## Getting Started  

Each project contains a **Makefile** that automates the compilation process.  
To compile a program, navigate to the respective folder and run:  

```sh
make
